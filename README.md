# PascalliteCompiler

A pascallite compiler writtin in C++ for a course I took my junior year of college. The project was originally made by my partner and I on local machine in the same room would revisions being uploaded to a Google Drive folder. This is why there are comments with dates and times as thats how we marked areas we changed when we updated the code without the other person being present. 

Our professor wrote the original documention and main function for the project and I do not have access to it at the moment. I'll update the project and this README with directions on how to run the compiler once he sends it over to me.
